    "In addition to non-linear mixing, the linear mixing model may not hold when considering spectral variability.   Spectral variability can be caused by environmental conditions (e.g., variations in illumination), atmospheric conditions (e.g., water in atmosphere), and inherent variability within a material.  Inherent variability depends on the scale of the endmember under consideration. For example, if a particular plant species is associated to one endmember, variation in this endmember may occur due to the upper and under-side of leaves of that species having different spectral signatures).  Spectral unmixing methods that account for spectral variability can be organized into two categories: set-based approaches and distribution-based approaches.  Set-based approaches represent an endmember using a discrete set of endmember spectra. Distribution-based approaches use a full probability distribution to represent an endmember and its associated variability.  Often, set-based approaches under-represent the variability whereas distribution-based approaches may over-represent the variability.
