# SPICE Sparsity Promoting Iterated Constrained Endmembers Algorithm
#       Finds Endmembers and Unmixes Input Data
# 
# Syntax: [endmembers, P] = SPICE(inputData, parameters)
# 
# Inputs:
#   inputData - double Mat - NxM matrix of M data points of
#       dimensionality N (i.e.  M pixels with N spectral bands, each pixel is
#       a column vector)
#   parameters - struct - The struct contains the following fields:
#                   1. u : Regularization Parameter for RSS and V terms
#                   2. gamma: Gamma Constant for SPT term
#                   3. changeThresh: Stopping Criteria, Change threshold
#                       for Objective Function.
#                   4. M: Initial Number of endmembers
#                   5. iterationCap: Maximum number of iterations
#                   6. endmemberPruneThreshold: Proportion threshold used
#                      to prune endmembers
#                   7. produceDisplay : Set to 1 if a progress display is
#                       wanted
#                   8. initEM: Set to nan to randomly select endmembers,
#                       otherwise NxM matrix of M endmembers with N spectral
#                       bands, Number of endmembers must equal parameters.M
# Outputs:
#   endmembers - double Mat - NxM matrix of M endmembers with N spectral
#       bands
#   P - double Mat - NxM matrix of abundances corresponding to M input
#       pixels and N endmembers
# Other m-files required: unmix, Matlab Optimization Toolbox
